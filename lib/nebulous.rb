##
# A little module that implements the Nebulous Protocol, a way of passing data
# over STOMP between different systems. We also support message cacheing via
# Redis.
#
# There are two use cases:
#
# First, sending a request for information and waiting for a response, which
# might come from a cache of previous responses, if you allow it. To do
# this you should create a Nebulous::NebRequest, which will return a
# Nebulous::Message.
#
# Second, the other end of the deal: hanging around waiting for requests and
# sending responses. To do this, you need to use the Nebulous::StompHandler
# class, which will again furnish Nebulous::Meessage objects, and allow you to
# create them.
#
# Some configuratuion is required: see Nebulous.init, Nebulous.add_target &
# Nebulous.add_logger.
#
# Since you are setting the Redis connection details as part of initialisation,
# you can also use it to connect to Redis, if you want. See
# Nebulous::RedisHandler.
