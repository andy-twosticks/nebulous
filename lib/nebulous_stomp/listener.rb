    # When creating a Listener, pass the queue name to listen on.
    #
    # This can be something stringlike, or a Target (in which case we listen on the target's
    # receiving queue).

    # Consume messages from the queue, yielding each.

    # Note that we don't block for input here. Just as with the Stomp gem, and with StompHandler,
    # you will need to take your own measures to ensure that your program does not end when it
    # should be waiting for messages to arrive. The simplest solution is something like:
    #
    #     loop do; pause 5; end
    #

      stomp_handler.listen(@queue) {|msg| yield msg }

    #
    # queue must be a queue name; message must be a Message.
