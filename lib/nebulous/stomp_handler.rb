      # Example:
      #  StompHandler.with_timeout(10) do |r|
      #    sleep 20
      #    r.signal
      #  end

      # arrange your own method of working out whether the timeout fired or not.
      #
      # Also, please note that when the timeout period expires, your code will
      # keep running. The timeout will only be honoured when your block
      # completes. This is very useful for Stomp.subscribe, but probably not
      # for anything else...
      #
      # There is a Ruby standard library for this, Timeout. But there appears to
      # be some argument as to whether it is threadsafe; so, we roll our own. It
      # probably doesn't matter since both Redis and Stomp do use Timeout. But.
